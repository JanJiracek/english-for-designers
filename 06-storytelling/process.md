# Self confidence of designer
## Process

Hey, if you are here, you probably wanna know how I created that presentation about self confidence of designer.

Before I knew theme of presentation I had to drew some random drawings and words on a paper.

Then I found out from the paper, that it would be cool to talk about self confidence of designer.

So I tried to make the presentation to two parts. First part will be about this paper and the second part about my own experiences which will be closely connected with the drawigns on a paper. 

And at the end I will summerize everthing what I said to a single slide.
