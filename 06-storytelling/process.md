# Self-confidence of designer
## Process

Hey, if you are here, you probably want to know how I created that presentation about the self-confidence of a designer.

Before I knew the theme of the presentation, I drew some random drawings and words on a piece of paper.

Then I found out from the paper, that it would be cool to talk about self confidence of designer.

So I tried to make the presentation to two parts. First part will be about this paper and the second part about my own experiences which will be closely connected with the drawigns on a paper. 

And at the end I will summerize everything what I said in presentation to a single slide.
