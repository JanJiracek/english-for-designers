# Self-confidence of designer
## Process

Hey, if you are here, you probably want to know how I created that presentation about the self-confidence of a designer.

Before I knew the theme of the presentation, I drew some random drawings and words on a piece of paper.

Then I found out from the drawings that it would be cool to talk about the self-confidence of a designer.

So I tried to make the presentation into two parts. The first part will be about this paper, and the second part about my own experiences, which will be closely connected width the drawings.

And at the end, I will summarize everything I said in the presentation in a single slide.
