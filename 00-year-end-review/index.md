# Year end review

### 1) What did you like most about this course?
I was most impressed by his teaching style and his friendly approach to us students Thanks to that I learned a lot of things and I always enjoyed the lessons.


### 2) What did you like least about this course?
Maybe it's just that we didn't have as much opportunity to speak English, only during the presentations. But that's just a small thing for me.


### 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?
I've learned how to present my professional work, how to create a great portfolio and resume, and last but not least, how to get the attention of whoever I'm targeting.


### 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?
When we had to split into groups and tell each other information about our projects. 


### 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
I am most proud of my portfolio that I created based on your assignment.


### 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?
I found out that I'm not the loser I thought I was and that I have a lot of great parts that I shouldn't be afraid to show to others. 


### 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?
I could have prepared more for the final presentation. 

### 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?
I personally liked the first assignment where we had to create a letter. Maybe it would be nice for me to have more tasks like that. 

### 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?
This question for me is quite related to the previous one. For me, it would be nice to have more assignments like the first one with the letter. This will improve not only my graphic design skills, but also my English description skills.

### 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
Definitely enjoy it, it's their last year and be open to improving yourself.
