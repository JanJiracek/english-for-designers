Pokud zrovna nejsem v práci nebo ve škole, tak dělám na svých soukromých zakázkách, které jsou úzce spojené s grafických designem. V tuhle dobu dělám například na vizuálu plechovek pro pipovar Clock.

My secondary work is photographing portraits, weddings and other events. It's not just about pulling the trigger, but also about communicating with the client. In my free time, I like to combine photography with graphic design, thanks to which I learn more about these two fields.
   
Inventing new visual identities for new and regular clients, including new logos, type of communications and so long.
My job is not only to come up with design on the screen, but also in reality. This means that I have to provide pre-press preparation.
