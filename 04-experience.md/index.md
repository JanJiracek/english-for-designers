<h3>Wextra Communications s.r.o.</h3>
<p>Inventing new visual identities for new and regular clients, including new logos, type of communications and so long.
My job is not only to come up with design on the screen, but also in reality. This means that I have to provide pre-press preparation.</p>

<h3>Professional photographer</h3>
<p>My secondary work is photographing portraits, weddings and other events. It's not just about pulling the trigger, but also about communicating with the client. In my free time, I like to combine photography with graphic design, thanks to which I learn more about these two fields.</p>

<h3>Freelance graphic designer</h3>
If I'm not at work or school I usually make my side jobs, which are closely connected with graphic design. For example I do new visuals for canned beer for craftbeer brewery called Clock at the moment.
