<h1>I'm Jan Jiracek</h1>

I am currently working as a junior graphic designer in Wextra communications and at the same time I am studying at a creative university, graphic and media design specialization.

I first encountered graphic design in high school, where I studied economics and accounting. It was there I discovered for the first time that I enjoy creative work connected to design. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but we had a subject there that was about graphic design and I really excelled in it.

I also enjoy playing the flute, dancing and playing computer games. 

The most important thing for me is humility  towards more experienced people, always friendly mood and do what you makes happy.

<h2>My 3 top works</h2>
<h3>Kostelecký pivní festival </h3>
<p>A real job, where the client needed to redesign their logo of the Kostelec beer festival, as well as the related posters and merch.</p>

<h3>Theatre Viola</h3>
<p>A school project for a real client, the Viola Theater, who asked us for a complete redesign of their existing materials, logo and communication. The goal was to modernize the graphic design and point out the uniqueness of the theater, which is based on a very small hall, where the audience is close to the actors.</p>

<p>
My team and I got into the selection process, where we won the logo and color scheme.</p>
