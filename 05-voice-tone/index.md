# Voice & Tone

This is a little guide for how I express myself through text.

## Voice

If I supposed to be a brand I will be:

1. Friendly. This is the most important value for me. Meeting new people, get along with then and making nice relations is just i major key for evolving my brand.
2. Confident. When I do something, nothing is more important than trust myself and my projects. That's how you sale something for your client more successfully.
3. Clear. Make sure to communicate everything as simply as possible... but mind that it has to be still functional. For example look at Steve Jobs and his presentations... just gorgeous.
4. Transparent. Don't be scared of sharing what happening inside brand. I think more transparent you are people will more trust you which is very important.

## Tone

Depending on situations, it's important to choose a right tone which will bring us right outcome. 

- Decent: When I communicate with someone new who might be very relevant for my brand I have to be at first moment decent and polite. It gives me a time to know this person and then I can change different tone to make it more friendly and calm atmosphere. 
- Funny & Frinedly: For example when I presentate project what takes very long time to explain something, it is necessary to intersperse the presentation with funny elements like memes, jokes and others.
- Empathy: I don't want to dictate anything to anyone, I want to understand people and solve their problems as good as possible.
