# Voice & Tone

This is a little guide for how I express myself through text.

## Voice

If I supposed to be a brand I will be:

1. Friendly. This is the most important value for me. Meeting new people, get along with then and making nice relations is just i major key for evolving my brand.
2. Confident. When I do something, nothing is more important than trust myself and my projects. That's how you sale something for your client more successfully.
3. Clear.
