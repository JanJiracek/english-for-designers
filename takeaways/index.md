Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. I've learned that my porfolio and CV can be created much more better than I thought.
2. How to work in GitHub.
3. English class can be funny and educational. Thanks to Justin! :)
4. Better presentation in English. 
5. Different way to show and explain my projects.
