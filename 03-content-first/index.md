<h1>About me</h1>

<u> <b>short version</b> </u>

I am a positive and reliable graphic designer who is not afraid to think about visual style differently than others.


<b>long version</b>

I am currently working as a junior graphic designer in Wextra communications and at the same time I am studying at a creative university, graphic and media design specialization.

I first encountered graphic design in high school, where I studied economics and accounting. It was there I discovered for the first time that I enjoy creative work connected to design. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but we had a subject there that was about graphic design and I really excelled in it.

I also enjoy playing the flute, dancing and playing computer games. 

<b>The most important thing for me is humility  towards more experienced people, always friendly mood and do what you makes happy.</b>

  <u> <b>CASE STUDY</b> </u>
  <h1>LOGO REDESIGN – ŠPINDLERŮV MLÝN</h1>

  <b>short description</b>    Modernize current logo of ski and leisure resort called Špindlerův Mlýn including mini example of visual identity.
  
  <b>CONTEXT</b>
  
  Špindlerův Mlýn certainly the most popular ski and leisure resort in the Czech Republic. It offers high quality hotels for relaxing or skiing and even in summer offers lots of activities as cycling, mountaineering and so long.

The resort of course wants to maintain its current position, it decided to redesign its logo and connect the city hotel part with the ski part. (for now they are seperated – different logos…)
