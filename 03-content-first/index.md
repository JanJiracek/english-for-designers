<h1>About me</h1>

<u> <b>short version</b> </u>

I am a positive and reliable graphic designer who is not afraid to think about visual style differently than others.


<b>long version</b>

I am currently working as a junior graphic designer in Wextra communications and at the same time I am studying at a creative university, graphic and media design specialization.

I first encountered graphic design in high school, where I studied economics and accounting. It was there I discovered for the first time that I enjoy creative work connected to design. It doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense, but we had a subject there that was about graphic design and I really excelled in it.

I'm very positive person who likes fun and being around nice people. I'm also huge fan of "wrum wrum" Formula 1, computer/board games and typography. I don't know if it's important to say this but I know every dialog from Simpsons in the movie :D

<b>The most important thing for me is humility towards more experienced people, always friendly mood at work and do what you makes happy, chichachochachi.</b>

  PS: be patient with me, sometimes I say some random word from my mounth.
